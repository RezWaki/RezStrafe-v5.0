# RezStrafe-v5.0
In this version I have done strafes counter, to enable it, set in *"RezStrafe.ini"* "Strafe" to "1"

Also in "stop strafing" key (9) added Half-Life window activation, so after stop autostrafe, Half-Life will be automatically set as active window

Of course I've a little bit optimized code
